# VelocityPlanning_DMP_FL
Analysis of a trajectory planning algorithm, with velocity characterization on the basis of the path geometry. The reference velocity is computed through Fuzzy Logic, while the execution is performed with the use of Dynamical Movement Primitives.

This thesis work uses a Fuzzy Logic library available at: https://github.com/carmelgafa/ml_from_scratch/tree/master/fuzzy_inference/fuzzy_system

While the re-adapted DMP framework is based on: https://github.com/studywolf/pydmps/tree/master/pydmps
